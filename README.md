# Districts of bangkok
This repository is for my capstone project for the IBM data science professional certificate. It was a requirement of the project to use Foursquare data in some way, which I tried to combine with socioeconomic data obtained from various Thai organizations to analyze clusters of districts in Bangkok. In summary, the results obtained are kind of interesting, but are so sensitive to choice of clustering algorithm and associated hyperparameters that I would be wary of drawing any strong conclusions from them.

In this repository I include the associated jupyter notebook, along with the raw data and a longer report on the project.
